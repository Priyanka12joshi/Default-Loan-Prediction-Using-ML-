#The implementation of the project follows these key steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distribution and correlations.

Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features to enhance prediction accuracy.

Model Selection & Training: Training models like XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.

Evaluation: Using metrics like F2-score, recall, and confusion matrix to compare models.

Deployment: Implementing a Flask API to serve predictions and storing results in a database.
